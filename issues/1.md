# Issue: Fix Error in `Update Project Status` Workflow

## Description
The following error is encountered in the `Update Project Status` workflow:

```
Error in contributor$total : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
```

This error occurs because `contributor` is an atomic vector when accessed with the `$` operator. To resolve this issue, please consider the following solutions:

1. Use `contributor[["total"]]` instead of `contributor$total`.
2. Ensure that `contributor` is a list or data.frame before accessing `contributor$total`.
