# Project template

The following is a checklist we aim to apply to every project.

## Common components

- [ ] Have the code available on GitHub.
- [ ] Have an example script using Jupyter, Rmarkdown, or related.
- [ ] Organize a workshop or a session.
- [ ] Have a clear set of installation instructions, e.g., using pip with Python or devtools with R.

## Desired goals

- [ ] Have an application using data or an application relevant for a local health department partner.
- [ ] Have a script/GUI/app that anyone can deploy. Ideally tested by local health department partners.
