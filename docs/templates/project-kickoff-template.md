Please consider the following when using the Project Kick-Off Template:
1.	This agenda template is intended to be used after the development of a project scope statement. This means that prior meetings with the partner(s) have already occurred, and you are preparing for a formalized kick-off call to review key project information.
2.	Ensure that there is a facilitator in the meeting who tracks the time allotments appropriately so that all agenda items are covered in a timely manner. 
3.	Some of the contents in the Project Kick-Off agenda is very much open to discussion and other perspectives. Part of the purpose of the Kick-Off Meeting is to align needs and goals alongside CFA partners, which will be a somewhat iterative process.
