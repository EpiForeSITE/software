# Readiness scale

During our meetings with CFA leadership, we started a discussion about how to categorize/classify our tools in terms of readiness. The key idea is to be able to identify what pieces of software or methods are ready for a public health response.

The Technology Readiness Scale developed by NASA serves as a baseline for what we can use in our project. The main drawback of NASA's scale is that is mostly designed/thought for hardware and not software. However, we can adapt it to our needs. 

- Is available to the public?
- Is written as a function?
- Is it documented?
- Is it tested?
- Is it bundled as a package/library?
- Can it be installed with a package manager, e.g., `R CMD INSTALL` or `pip install`?
- Has it been used with real data?
- Has it been used in a real-world scenario, e.g., during a public health emergency?
