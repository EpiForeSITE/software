## In a nutshell

- Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative
  development, collaboration, and customer feedback.

- Agile is a flexible and adaptive approach to software development that
  focuses on delivering value to the customer.

- Agile is based on the principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto,
  which emphasizes individuals and interactions, working software,
  customer collaboration, and responding to change.

- Agile requires frequent interaction between developers and customers,
  as well as a willingness to adapt to changing requirements.

- A common practice in agile development is the use of sprints, which
  are short, time-boxed development cycles that typically last between
  one and four weeks.

- Agile is often used in conjunction with other software development
  methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming.

The following is a diagram from Inflectra that illustrates the Agile
methodology:

## For ForeSITE

We plan to use the following components from the Agile methodology:

- Sprints: Bi-weekly
- Stand-up meetings: As frequent as possible (daily recommended for
  15-mins).
- Retrospectives and planning: At the beginning of each sprint.

We will use the following tools:

- GitHub repositories for code management.
- GitHub issues for tracking tasks.
- Sprints will be organized using milestones in GitHub.
