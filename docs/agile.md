## In a nutshell

- Agile is a flexible and adaptive approach to software development
  based on the principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto.

- It focuses on delivering value to the customer through iterative
  development, collaboration, and customer feedback.

- Agile requires frequent interaction between developers and customers
  and a willingness to adapt to changing requirements.

- The Agile umbrella emcompasses several software development
  methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming, each
  with unique strengths and weaknesses.

- A common practice in agile development is the use of sprints, which
  are short, time-boxed development cycles that typically last between
  one and four weeks.

The following diagram from Inflectra illustrates the Agile methodology:

## For ForeSITE

We plan to use the following components from the Agile methodology:

- Sprints: Bi-weekly
- Stand-up meetings: As frequent as possible (daily recommended for
  15-mins)
- Retrospectives and planning: At the beginning of each sprint

We will use the following tools:

- GitHub repositories for code management.
- GitHub issues for tracking tasks.
- GitHub milestones for organizing sprints.

### Sprint planning

1.  Use the first 15 minutes of the sprint planning meeting to review
    the previous sprint.

2.  Use about 10 minutes to discuss the goals for the upcoming sprint.

3.  Write up the goals (as issues) in a new milestone for the sprint.

4.  Assign issues to team members.
