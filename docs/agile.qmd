## In a nutshell

- Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback.

- Agile is a flexible and adaptive approach to software development that focuses on delivering value to the customer.

- Agile is based on the principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto, which emphasizes individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

- Agile requires frequent interaction between developers and customers, as well as a willingness to adapt to changing requirements.

- A common practice in agile development is the use of sprints, which are short, time-boxed development cycles that typically last between one and four weeks.

- Agile is often used in conjunction with other software development methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming.

The following is a diagram from Inflectra that illustrates the Agile methodology:

## For ForeSITE

We plan to use the following components from the Agile methodology:

- Sprints: Bi-weekly
- Stand-up meetings: As frequent as possible (daily recommended for 15-mins).
- Retrospectives and planning: At the beginning of each sprint.

We will use the following tools:

- GitHub repositories for code management.
- GitHub issues for tracking tasks.
- Sprints will be organized using milestones in GitHub.

### Sprint planning

1. Use the first 15 minutes of the sprint planning meeting to review the previous sprint.

2. Use about 10 minutes to discuss the goals for the upcoming sprint.

3. Write up the goals (as issues) in a new milestone for the sprint.

4. Assign issues to team members.
