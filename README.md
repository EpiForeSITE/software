| N | Tool | Description |
|---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | Example - Flexible Epidemic Modeling Pipeline (flepiMoP) (R, Python) | Simulates a wide range of compartmental models of infectious disease transmission. The disease transmission and observation models are defined by a no-code configuration file, which allows models of varying complexity to be specified quickly and consistently, from simple problems described by SIR-style models in a single population to more complicated models of multiple pathogen strains transmitting between thousands of connected spatial divisions and age groups.<br>([Learn more…](profiles.md#sec-example---flexible-epidemic-modeling-pipeline--flepimop-))<br> |

| 10 | Autoencoder and clustering based anomaly detection (Python) | Initially developed as a project with DHS Science and Technology, this project took place from 2018 to 2019 (pre-COVID). The approach here is to find potentially anomalous cases which are also related. To create anomaly “scores”, a neural network autoencoder is used to process over patient data from the emergency department visit and quantify how “rare” this kind of visit might be compared to all other previous visits. Then a density-based clustering is used to identify any potential clusters of anomalous cases since one single case may not warrant concern, but a group of patients with similar labs, signs/symptoms, etc might suggest common exposures and conditions.<br>([Learn more…](profiles.md#sec-autoencoder-and-clustering-based-anomaly-detection))<br> |
| 11 | Nowcasting (TBD) | Given the time lag between laboratory testing for disease and eventual reporting, we’ve developed a model which consumes data from both community and VA to predict “now” how many positive tests for a disease (COVID-19 in this context) will eventually be reported as positive. A VA HSR&D abstract is available.<br>([Learn more…](profiles.md#sec-nowcasting))<br> |
| 12 | Statistical Alerts (time series) (R) | We have supported an Operations system for processing time series for “aberrations” (aka, “alerts”, “potential outbreaks”) for 8+ years in VA BASIC. During this time, we’ve integrated several among the suite of algorithms available in the R package titled “surveillance”. This includes several classes of numerical methods, of which some are window-based, control chart-based or trained linear models. A brief presentation on this is attached here.<br>([Learn more…](profiles.md#sec-statistical-alerts--time-series-))<br> |
| 13 | Cumulative infection (R, SAS) | We’ve used Mortality Mapping (mMAP), an existing epidemiologic and statistical analysis approach by Lu et al. \[1,2\] to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in Veterans in the United States. mMAP is a time series deconvolution method which infers the true COVID-19 case counts from reported COVID-19 deaths. It uses symptom onset to death distribution, smoothed time series of reported COVID-19 deaths, and symptomatic case fatality rate (sCFR) to estimate the distribution of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. We focus on the adjusted version of the mMAP approach presented by Lu et al., which tries to account for the unreported COVID-19 deaths. While Lu uses excess influenza and pneumonia deaths to account for unreported COVID-19 deaths, we have extended their approach by using excess all-cause deaths. <br>([Learn more…](profiles.md#sec-cumulative-infection))<br> |
