tool_name: Vaccine Hesitancy Model
tool_description: 'An ODE (ordinary differential equation)-based SVEIR model with
  3 compartments for symptoms (mild, moderate, severe) that can quantify the tradeoffs
  between vaccine efficacy and vaccine hesitancy on reducing the disease burden. Scenarios(s)
  Modeled: R0, cumulative infections, and deaths due to varying values of transmission
  rate, vaccine coverage rate, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine hesitancy. The vaccine
  efficacy required to compensate for different levels of vaccine hesitancy.'
