tool_name: Branching process outbreak simulator
brief_description: 'Quantifies risk posed by individual importers of a novel transmissible
  pathogen to a generic population, with intervention effects. Scenarios(s) Modeled:
  Novel introduction of transmissible pathogen by infected traveler, by accidentally
  infected laboratory worker, or similar scenario; intervention scenarios for improved
  detection of initial case and for delayed mitigation after ongoing outbreak is detected.'

is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'No'
relevant_disease_s: Any emerging transmissible pathogen; we have applied the tool
  to Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
maturity: R code used for publication results is reasonably organized and documented
  but not publicly available. Key functions have been shared and used by others; could
  be made publicly available or packaged for use with reasonable effort.

audience_type: TBD
required_expertise_to_use_tool: TBD
type_of_tool: Epidemic Model - Scenario Modeling
type_of_data_input_needed: Generic population model applicable to local community
  experiencing the initial importation / infection.

pkg_dev_assessment_how_hard_is_to_make_into_a_package_notes: All code is functions
  only. It could be bundled into an R pkg very easily. We only need to have an example
  so it is more complete.
overall_assessment_easy_win_needs_some_work_needs_lots_of_work_long_term_project: Easy
  win - Functions are already in a separate file, just need to be added to a namespace/__init__.py
  file.
