tool_name: Branching process outbreak simulator
tool_description: 'Quantifies risk posed by individual importers of a novel transmissible
  pathogen to a generic population, with intervention effects. Scenarios(s) Modeled:
  Novel introduction of transmissible pathogen by infected traveler, by accidentally
  infected laboratory worker, or similar scenario; intervention scenarios for improved
  detection of initial case and for delayed mitigation after ongoing outbreak is detected.'

  be made publicly available or packaged for use with reasonable effort.
