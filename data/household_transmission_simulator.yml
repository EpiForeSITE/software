tool_name: Household transmission simulator
brief_description: 'Simulate household importation and within-household transmission
  across a population of households, and intervention effects, e.g. vaccination. Scenarios(s)
  Modeled: Household importation and transmission with variability in transmissibility
  and heterogeneity across age groups and vaccination status.'
name_of_developer_maintainer_or_key_contact: Damon Toth
email_of_developer_maintainer_or_key_contact: Damon.Toth@hsc.utah.edu
is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'No'
relevant_disease_s: Any household-transmissible pathogen; tool has previously been
  used for SARS-CoV-2
maturity: R code for basic simulation is publicly available [https://github.com/damontoth/householdTransmission].
  Extensions with age heterogeneity and vaccination are under development. Could be
  packaged for wider use.
