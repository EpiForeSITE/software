tool_name: Healthcare transmission epidemiology estimation at equilibrium
tool_description: 'Estimate the extent of patient-to-patient transmission and other
  quantities using admission prevalence and cross-sectional point-prevalence data
  for carriage of organisms among healthcare facility in-patients. Parameter estimated:
  Patient-to-patient transmission rate, facility reproduction number, rate of progression
  to infection, intervention effects if applicable. Estimates derived via solving
  differential equations at equilibrium and facility reproduction number equations.'

is_maintained: 'No'
relevant_diseases: Any healthcare-transmissible pathogen with appropriate data; we
  have applied our tools to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, C. difficile,
  and S. aureus.
maturity: R code used for publication results is reasonably organized and documented
  but not publicly available. Key functions have been shared and used by others; could
  be made publicly available or packaged for use with reasonable effort. Creating
  an R package for facility reproduction number calculations has been discussed.

tool_type: Parameter estimation 
input_type: Appropriate for application to data sets for patient carriage
  prevalence at admission and cross-sectional in-patient prevalence, when these quantities
  are stable over time. Contextual data for length of stay, invasive infection rates,
  carriage duration and intervention efforts add utility. Useful for understanding
  transmission risk and threshold effects in healthcare facilities, and for estimating
  intervention effectiveness.
