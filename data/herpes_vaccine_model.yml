tool_name: Herpes Vaccine Model
tool_description: 'An ODE-based 6-compartment SI model with asymptomatic carriers
  and vaccinated classes to forecast the number of infections prevented with imperfect
  vaccination and infections prevented per vaccine administered. Parameter estimated:
  Highly correlated parameters determined using LHS PRCC. Scenarios(s) Modeled: Prophylactic
  (pre-exposure) vaccines, Therapeutic (post-exposure) vaccines, Parameter(s) Estimated:
  Highly correlated parameters determined using LHS PRCC'

maturity: Matlab program for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (Latin Hypercube
  Sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient analysis) in development and nearing
  completion. Old C/C++ code is being recoded in Matlab and R and should be ready
  soon (~April 2024).
