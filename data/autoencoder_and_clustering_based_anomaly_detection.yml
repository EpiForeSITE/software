tool_name: Autoencoder and clustering based anomaly detection
tool_description: Initially developed as a project with DHS Science and Technology,
  this project took place from 2018 to 2019 (pre-COVID).  The approach here is to
  find potentially anomalous cases which are also related.  To create anomaly “scores”,
  a neural network autoencoder is used to process over patient data from the emergency
  department visit and quantify how “rare” this kind of visit might be compared to
  all other previous visits.  Then a density-based clustering is used to identify
  any potential clusters of anomalous cases since one single case may not warrant
  concern, but a group of patients with similar labs, signs/symptoms, etc might suggest
  common exposures and conditions.

is_maintained: N/A
relevant_diseases: NA
maturity: Still early in its maturity.  Early investigations show that this currently
  emits too many potential “anomaly clusters” to be useful, so sensitivity needs to
  be reduced before being used in an operation capacity
