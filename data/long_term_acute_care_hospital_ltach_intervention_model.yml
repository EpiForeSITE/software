tool_name: Long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) intervention model
tool_description: 'Provides analytic framework for investigating patient-focused
  interventions to prevent transmission in high-risk healthcare facilities and their
  direct and population-level health impacts and threshold effects. Scenarios(s) Modeled:
  Intervention scenarios for surveillance and isolation (contact precautions), decolonization
  drugs, infection treatment, horizontal transmission reduction, and length of stay
  reduction.'

is_maintained: 'No'
relevant_diseases: Any pathogen posing risk of hospital transmission among in-patients;
  we have applied the model to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
maturity: R code used for publication results is reasonably organized and documented
  but not publicly available. Key functions have been shared and used by others; could
  be made publicly available or packaged for use with reasonable effort.
license: TBD
languages: R
audience_type: TBD
required_expertise: TBD
tool_type: Epidemic Model - Scenario Modeling
input_type: Single-facility model tailored to data from Chicago area
  LTACHs experiencing CRE outbreaks; could be re-tailored to other facility types
