tool_name: Dose-response estimators for infection risk
tool_description: 'Estimate infection probability from a given dose of exposure using
  data sets from experimental dose-quantified exposures of humans or animals; model-based
  results used to perform quantitative risk assessment for potential human exposure
  scenarios. Parameter estimated: Per-unit-dose infection probability and associated
  additional parameters for more complicated dose-response models, including those
  that quantify dose-dependent latent/incubation period; can convert estimates to
  common “infectious dose” quantification metrics such as “ID-50.” Estimates derived
  via maximum likelihood for multiple equation-based dose-response models fit to exposure-response
  data.'

is_maintained: 'No'
relevant_diseases: Any pathogen with appropriate data; we have applied our tools
  to Anthrax, Ebola, influenza, SARS-CoV-1, tularemia, Yersina pestis, Rift Valley
  fever, Andes virus, Lassa virus.
maturity: R code used for publication results is organized and documented but not
  publicly available. Could be made publicly available or packaged for use with moderate
  effort.
