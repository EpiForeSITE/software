tool_name: Transmission estimation for outbreak clusters
brief_description: 'Provides estimates for individual-level transmission distribution
  (mean and variance) based on data from prior isolated outbreak clusters. Useful
  for quantifying the risk of superspreading events and the risk that future outbreaks
  will exceed a given threshold.Parameter estimated: Basic reproduction number; dispersion
  parameter quantifying variance in transmission; extensions estimate changes in reproduction
  number by generation, e.g. post-control reproduction number. Estimated via maximum
  likelihood using final size distribution equations for branching process models.'

is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'No'
relevant_disease_s: Applied to pathogens with subcritical transmission (R < 1) though
  also relevant for emerging R > 1 pathogens that have not (yet) produced widespread
  sustained transmission in the given context. We have applied the tool to Ebola and
  Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
maturity: R code used for publication results is reasonably organized and documented
  but not publicly available. Key functions have been shared and used by others; could
  be made publicly available or packaged for use with reasonable effort.

type_of_tool: Parameter estimationÂ 
type_of_data_input_needed: Appropriate for pathogens that have produced a series of
  isolated, extinguished outbreak clusters following an initial introduction, e.g.
  zoonotic spillover events or infected incoming travelers followed by a chain of
  human-to-human transmissions.
