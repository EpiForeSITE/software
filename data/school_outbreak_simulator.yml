tool_name: School outbreak simulator
brief_description: 'Agent-based simulation of person-to-person transmission at schools
  over data-based dynamic proximity contact networks. Scenarios(s) Modeled:  Transmission
  modeled during school hours; can model interventions affecting the contact network
  and school attendance behavior.'

email_of_developer_maintainer_or_key_contact: Damon.Toth@hsc.utah.edu
is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'No'
relevant_disease_s: Influenza; could be repurposed for similarly transmitted diseases.
maturity: Written in Anylogic, a Java-based simulation software that is not free or
  publicly available. Code must be run on old machines that still have the software.
  Contact data are publicly available* and could be used as basis for simulation on
  other platforms. *https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rsif.2015.0279
