pkg_dev_assessment_how_hard_is_to_make_into_a_package_notes: "Potentially a python
  module. There are functions and classes that are well-defined. Maybe exporting the
  classes should be enough.\r\n\r\nBut it also has hardcoded stuff in the class def
  files."
overall_assessment_easy_win_needs_some_work_needs_lots_of_work_long_term_project: Needs
  some work - Functions/classes are mixed with the code. Need to separate them and
  add them to namespace/__init__.py file.
