tool_name: 'epiworld-forecasts: Automatic Disease Forecasting with epiworldR'
tool_description: epiworld-forecasts uses epiworldR, GitHub Actions, and Docker to generate 
  disease forecasts that update automatically. While we provide an example forecast of 
  COVID-19 case counts in Utah, this tool is an open-source, template repository that can 
  easily be adapted to generate forecasts for different diseases.
