tool_name: Excess Death Estimation
brief_description: The aberration detection methods introduced by Farrington et al.
  and later Noufaily et al. have been implemented to obtain weekly all-cause mortality
  data.

is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'Yes'
relevant_disease_s: None.  Kelly believes this was all cause mortality estimation.
maturity: We already have a version of this in operations

audience_type: TBD
required_expertise_to_use_tool: TBD
type_of_tool: Statistical Model - Forecasting
type_of_data_input_needed: Data sources for this include both inpatient and outpatient
  mortality records. The ‘surveillance’ package in R was used to implement both the
  original Farrington method and the Flexible Farrington method by Noufaily et al.
  depending on the options specified. Control slots are used to specify which options
  are to be used. These options are customizable, but a strength of Farrington-based
  algorithms is that they are relatively robust across applications. Many of the options
  we have used are based on algorithm defaults. Additionally, ‘Nobbs’ nowcasting package
  in R was used to address delays in death reporting before applying Flexible Farrington.
