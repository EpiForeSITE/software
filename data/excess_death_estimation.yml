input_type: Data sources for this include both inpatient and outpatient
  mortality records. The ‘surveillance’ package in R was used to implement both the
  original Farrington method and the Flexible Farrington method by Noufaily et al.
  depending on the options specified. Control slots are used to specify which options
  are to be used. These options are customizable, but a strength of Farrington-based
  algorithms is that they are relatively robust across applications. Many of the options
  we have used are based on algorithm defaults. Additionally, ‘Nobbs’ nowcasting package
  in R was used to address delays in death reporting before applying Flexible Farrington.
