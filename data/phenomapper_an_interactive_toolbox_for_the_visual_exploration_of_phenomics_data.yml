type_of_data_input_needed: PhenoMapper is an extension of Mapper Interactive, which
  is a web-based framework for interactive analysis and visualization of high-dimensional
  point cloud data built upon the mapper algorithm.Our approach uses the mapper framework
  to perform a topological analysis of the data, and subsequently render visual representations
  with built-in data analysis and machine learning capabilities.
