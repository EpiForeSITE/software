tool_name: Nowcasting
brief_description: Given the time lag between laboratory testing for disease and eventual
  reporting, we’ve developed a model which consumes data from both community and VA
  to predict “now” how many positive tests for a disease (COVID-19 in this context)
  will eventually be reported as positive.  A VA HSR&D abstract is available.

relevant_disease_s: Currently this has only been applied to COVID-19, but a similar
  approach could be feasible for other diseases as well.
maturity: Still early in its maturity.  We’ve had this running but have not yet started
  consuming this by analysts or stakeholders to assess value or accuracy.
