tool_name: Granular Modeling Framework/ICU
tool_description: 'Implement 2 ICUs that match the CVICU at the University of Utah
  and the ICU at the Salt Lake City VA.  Model all empirical data collected by the
  GM project:  HCW movement and touch data as collected by the proximity sensors,
  Patient flow from the EHR, and micro data as sampled by the GM micro team.  Scenarios(s)
  Modeled: Sustained endemic HAI levels driven by importation into a 15-25 bed ICU.  Contamination
  and transmission via HCW movement and contact behaviors.  The simulation includes
  contamination of multiple surfaces in several room zones, contamination of patient
  surfaces via shedding and HCW surfaces via touching.  Room cleaning, isolation,
  and targeted treatment of HAI.  HCW visits include assigned networks between health
  care workers and patients as well as ad hoc visits.'

is_maintained: 'Yes'
relevant_diseases: Only C.Diff currently implemented, but all organisms sampled in
  the GM project were targeted.
maturity: The framework is developed in Java/Groovy in the Repast Simphony toolset.  It
  is intended to be useable to quickly model fresh scenarios relatively quickly.  In
  practice, it is currently only useable by Willy.  Willy is able to use it to develop
  new models and features in existing models fairly quickly, but no-one else will
  be able to do that at this point.  The GM model and the underlying framework are
  hosted on github, but updates on the remote are far behind the commits that have
  been made by the developer.  The GM model itself if hung up on parameter estimation.
