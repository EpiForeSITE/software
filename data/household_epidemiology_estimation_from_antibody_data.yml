tool_name: Household epidemiology estimation from antibody data
tool_description: 'Simultaneously estimate household importation risk, household
  secondary attack rate, and associated variability / heterogeneities using point-prevalence
  data for antibody positivity among household members. Parameter estimated: Household
  importation probability, household secondary attack rate, sensitivity / specificity
  of data for indicating prior infection, variability (dispersion) in transmissibility,  and
  heterogeneities in those quantities over age and/or other identifiable characteristics
  of individuals and households. Estimates derived via maximum likelihood for final
  household outbreak size equations.'

tool_type: Parameter estimationÂ 
input_type: Appropriate for application to data sets for prevalence
  of antibody positivity (e.g. via testing of serological samples) from members of
  randomly sampled households; useful for understanding transmission risk in close-contact
  indoor settings and mechanisms of epidemiological differences across demographic
  factors. Can also be applied to residents/staff of small nursing homes.
