tool_name: CU Metapopulation
brief_description: 'Stochastic representation of an ICU in a tertiary care academic
  medical center. Scenarios(s) Modeled: Staffing changes, cohorting (with some effort),
  decolonization, fecal transplant, antibiotic stewardship (with some modifications).
  Others are possible.'

is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'No'
relevant_disease_s: MRSA, C. difficile. COVID-19, SARS, and Ebola are works in progress.
maturity: Python code is available on GitHub, but is honestly a little gnarly (a complex
  configuration file is involved).

type_of_tool: Epidemic Model - Scenario Modeling
type_of_data_input_needed: This is the main “workhorse” model for modeling ICUs in
  my lab. It currently isn’t connected to hospital or community-level models.

pkg_dev_assessment_how_hard_is_to_make_into_a_package_notes: Some mix of R and python
  code. Python functions (which run the analysis) are mostly isolated.
overall_assessment_easy_win_needs_some_work_needs_lots_of_work_long_term_project: Needs
  some work - Functions/classes are mixed with the code. Need to separate them and
  add them to namespace/__init__.py file.
