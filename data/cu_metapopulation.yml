tool_name: CU Metapopulation
tool_description: 'Stochastic representation of an ICU in a tertiary care academic
  medical center. Scenarios(s) Modeled: Staffing changes, cohorting (with some effort),
  decolonization, fecal transplant, antibiotic stewardship (with some modifications).
  Others are possible.'
contact_name: Eric Lofgren
contact_email: Eric.Lofgren@wsu.edu
is_maintained: 'No'
relevant_diseases: MRSA, C. difficile. COVID-19, SARS, and Ebola are works in progress.
maturity: Python code is available on GitHub, but is honestly a little gnarly (a complex
  configuration file is involved).
license: TBD
languages: Python

tool_type: Epidemic Model - Scenario Modeling
input_type: This is the main “workhorse” model for modeling ICUs in
  my lab. It currently isn’t connected to hospital or community-level models.

is_complete: 'yes'
pkg_dev_assessment: Some mix of R and python
  code. Python functions (which run the analysis) are mostly isolated.
overall_assessment: Needs
  some work - Functions/classes are mixed with the code. Need to separate them and
  add them to namespace/__init__.py file.
