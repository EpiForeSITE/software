tool_name: Healthcare facility network outbreak simulator
brief_description: 'Provides flexible framework for agent-based simulation of outbreaks
  among in-patients in a generic-but-realistic network of short/long-stay hospitals
  and nursing homes, as well as interventions to mitigate transmission and inter-facility
  spread. Scenarios(s) Modeled:  Initial invasion of new pathogen / strain and/or
  endemic pathogens. Intervention scenarios for patient-targeted efforts including
  surveillance and isolation (contact precautions), vaccination, and anti-microbial
  drug treatment.'

is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'No'
relevant_disease_s: Any healthcare-associated pathogen(s); we have applied the model
  to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, C. difficile, and MRSA.
maturity: Written in Anylogic, a Java-based simulation software that is not free or
  publicly available. Code must be run on old machines that still have the software.
  Effort was made to convert the model to publicly available software Repast (by Willy
  Ray) but was not completed.

type_of_tool: Epidemic Model - Scenario Modeling
type_of_data_input_needed: Local network of hospitals and nursing homes that directly
  exchange patients, as well as generic “community” component to track discharged
  / readmitted patients after and between hospital stays.
