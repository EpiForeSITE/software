tool_name: 'epiworldpy: A python wrapper for epiworld'
tool_description: A flexible framework for Agent-Based Models (ABM), the 'epiworldR'
  package provides methods for prototyping disease outbreaks and transmission models
  using a 'C++' backend, making it very fast. It supports multiple epidemiological
  models, including the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS), Susceptible-Infected-Removed
  (SIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR), and others, involving arbitrary
  mitigation policies and multiple-disease models. Users can specify infectiousness/susceptibility
  rates as a function of agents' features, providing great complexity for the model
  dynamics. Furthermore, 'epiworldR' is ideal for simulation studies featuring large
  populations.
