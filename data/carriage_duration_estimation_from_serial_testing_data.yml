tool_name: Carriage duration estimation from serial testing data
tool_description: 'Estimate the duration and heterogeneity of individuals’ colonization
  episodes for organisms of interest. Parameter estimated: Average and distribution
  of clearance rate(s) across multiple candidate model forms, average (re)acquisition
  rate, sensitivity/specificity of testing. Estimates derived via maximum likelihood
  techniques.'

is_maintained: TBD
relevant_diseases: Any pathogen with appropriate serialized test data; we have applied
  our tools to S. aureus.
maturity: R code used for publication results is publicly available on Github [https://github.com/alexbeams/StaphCarrierTypes]
  with documentation. Could be packaged for wider use.
license: TBD
languages: R
audience_type: TBD
required_expertise: TBD
tool_type: Parameter estimation 
input_type: Appropriate for application to data sets from repeated
  testing of the same individuals over long time periods relative to typical carriage
  duration. Useful for understanding dynamics of background carriage in a wide population,
  important to understand for evaluating intervention effectiveness.
