tool_name: Statistical Alerts (time series)
tool_description: We have supported an Operations system for processing time series
  for “aberrations” (aka, “alerts”, “potential outbreaks”) for 8+ years in VA BASIC.  During
  this time, we’ve integrated several among the suite of algorithms available in the
  R package titled “surveillance”.  This includes several classes of numerical methods,
  of which some are window-based, control chart-based or trained linear models.  A
  brief presentation on this is attached here.

is_maintained: 'Yes'
relevant_diseases: Many.  We use this system for hundreds of different case definitions,
  ranging from COVID-19 to Zika, to drug resistant organisms, to Dengue, etc.
maturity: This has been deployed for Operations for years, but each algorithm has
  different properties and parameters.  Kelly would say that our current parameters
  are better tuned but still not ideal.  A collection of curated time series and human
  identified “aberration events” would likely be helpful.

input_type: Currently this is VA time series, could be applied to any
  time series with some de-coupling.  As far as technology, currently we’ve implemented
  an implementation which is a Python wrapper (epysurv) over the R package mentioned
  above.  This was selected since the API is more consistent in that it attempts to
  match the popular scikit-learn package.  Further, BASIC has more experience in Python
  than R.
docs_link: The way that we implement this system has
  not been published, but there are links for “surveillance” (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveillance/index.html)and
  “epysurv” packages (https://epysurv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
