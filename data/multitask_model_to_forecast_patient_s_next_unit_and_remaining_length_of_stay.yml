tool_name: Multitask Model to Forecast Patient's Next Unit and Remaining Length of
  Stay
brief_description: 'Length of Stay prediction and unit transfer prediction tool. Scenarios(s)
  Modeled: In this multi-task learning model, we train the model to predict:Task-1:
  patient''s unit label in next time step. Task-2: patient''s remaining length of
  stay.The model inputs get updated on a daily basis and generates prediction accordingly.'

type_of_data_input_needed: This is the source code for building a deep learning model
  using multi-task learning (MTL) approach. The model is designed to train and validate
  on data prepared from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The model was designed to
  learn and predict adaptively along the patient's stay. The model appends new data
  about the patient as it becomes available and update the prediction value accordingly.

pkg_dev_assessment_how_hard_is_to_make_into_a_package_notes: "Has a handful of functions
  (3) well-defined. This could be a small python package.\r\n\r\nFunctions for paper
  figures can be set aside."

  win - Functions are already in a separate file, just need to be added to a namespace/__init__.py
  file.
