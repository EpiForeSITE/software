tool_name: Cumulative infection
brief_description: We’ve used Mortality Mapping (mMAP), an existing epidemiologic
  and statistical analysis approach by Lu et al. [1,2] to estimate the cumulative
  incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in Veterans in the United States. mMAP is a time
  series deconvolution method which infers the true COVID-19 case counts from reported
  COVID-19 deaths. It uses symptom onset to death distribution, smoothed time series
  of reported COVID-19 deaths, and symptomatic case fatality rate (sCFR) to estimate
  the distribution of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. We focus on the adjusted version
  of the mMAP approach presented by Lu et al., which tries to account for the unreported
  COVID-19 deaths. While Lu uses excess influenza and pneumonia deaths to account
  for unreported COVID-19 deaths, we have extended their approach by using excess
  all-cause deaths.

type_of_data_input_needed: Data sources use US case data to identify the time periods
  for COVID-19 waves. Using the VA COVID-19 Shared Data Resource, we identified reported
  COVID-19 cases and deaths. Excess death details from above.   Currently developed
  in R.
