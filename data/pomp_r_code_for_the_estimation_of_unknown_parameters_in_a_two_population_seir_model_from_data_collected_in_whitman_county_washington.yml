tool_name: pomp R code for the estimation of unknown parameters in a two-population
  SEIR model from data collected in Whitman County, Washington
brief_description: 'Build a two-population SEIR model using the pomp coding framework
  in R and estimate the unknown parameters in this model using the PMCMC algorithm.
  Parameter estimated: Transmission parameters (transmission within each population
  and transmission across the two-populations), testing probability, and overdispersion
  parameter.'

type_of_data_input_needed: This model was developed to model COVID-19 in Whitman County,
  Washington. This location has distinct university (WSU) and community populations
  where COVID was transmitted differently within each population with minimal cross-population
  transmission.
