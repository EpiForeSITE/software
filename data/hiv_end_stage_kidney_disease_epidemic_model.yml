tool_name: HIV End Stage Kidney Disease Epidemic Model
tool_description: 'An ODE-based model to predict future disease prevalence given
  the impact of drug therapy levels and its mechanism of action (i.e., stopping progression
  to disease or reducing deaths). Parameter estimated:  Growth rate, death rate, drug
  efficacy to block disease progression. Scenarios(s) Modeled: Rebound in prevalence
  due to insufficient therapy (e.g., like in Paxlovid rebound).'
