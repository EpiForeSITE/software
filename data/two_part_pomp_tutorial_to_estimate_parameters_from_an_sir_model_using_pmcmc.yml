tool_name: Two-part pomp tutorial to estimate parameters from an SIR model using PMCMC
tool_description: 'To goal of this two-part tutorial is to demonstrate how to implement
  an SIR epidemiological model in the pomp R package in part 1, and then estimate
  the unknown parameters in part 2. The tutorial is designed to focus on the R code.
  Parameter estimated: This tutorial gives a specific example of estimating the transmission
  and testing probability parameters using pomp.'
