tool_name: COVID-19 Jail Model
brief_description: 'Deterministic model of a stylized jail, with a number of potential
  interventions developed in collaboration with the ACLU. Scenarios(s) Modeled: Decarceration,
  social distancing, targeted or widespread arrest reduction, isolation.'

is_it_actively_maintained_yes_no: 'Yes'
relevant_disease_s: COVID-19. Likely easily adaptable to other respiratory pathogens.
maturity: Code is available on R, and currently runs very cleanly thanks to some data
  scientists who know modern R programming techniques. Adaptation to a dashboard type
  system seems like it should be straightforward. Stochastic implementation will take
  work.

type_of_tool: Epidemic Model - Scenario Modeling
type_of_data_input_needed: This model was developed as part of a project for the ACLU
  to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on jails, as well as estimate the effect of interventions
  believed to be feasible both from the ACLU’s standpoint and likely local criminal
  justice groups. It’s for a single jail and the surrounding county within that jail
  is located.

pkg_dev_assessment_how_hard_is_to_make_into_a_package_notes: It looks fairly complex,
  but the functions are isolated enough to be packaged out.
overall_assessment_easy_win_needs_some_work_needs_lots_of_work_long_term_project: Easy
  win - Functions are already in a separate file, just need to be added to a namespace/__init__.py
  file.
