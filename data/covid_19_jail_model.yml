tool_name: COVID-19 Jail Model
tool_description: 'Deterministic model of a stylized jail, with a number of potential
  interventions developed in collaboration with the ACLU. Scenarios(s) Modeled: Decarceration,
  social distancing, targeted or widespread arrest reduction, isolation.'
contact_name: Eric Lofgren
contact_email: Eric.Lofgren@wsu.edu
is_maintained: 'Yes'
relevant_diseases: COVID-19. Likely easily adaptable to other respiratory pathogens.
maturity: Code is available on R, and currently runs very cleanly thanks to some data
  scientists who know modern R programming techniques. Adaptation to a dashboard type
  system seems like it should be straightforward. Stochastic implementation will take
  work.

tool_type: Epidemic Model - Scenario Modeling
input_type: This model was developed as part of a project for the ACLU
  to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on jails, as well as estimate the effect of interventions
  believed to be feasible both from the ACLU’s standpoint and likely local criminal
  justice groups. It’s for a single jail and the surrounding county within that jail
  is located.
