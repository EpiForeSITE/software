## Cumulative infection

We’ve used Mortality Mapping (mMAP), an existing epidemiologic and statistical analysis approach by Lu et al. [1,2] to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in Veterans in the United States. mMAP is a time series deconvolution method which infers the true COVID-19 case counts from reported COVID-19 deaths. It uses symptom onset to death distribution, smoothed time series of reported COVID-19 deaths, and symptomatic case fatality rate (sCFR) to estimate the distribution of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. We focus on the adjusted version of the mMAP approach presented by Lu et al., which tries to account for the unreported COVID-19 deaths. While Lu uses excess influenza and pneumonia deaths to account for unreported COVID-19 deaths, we have extended their approach by using excess all-cause deaths.

## epiworld: Fast Agent-Based Epi Models

A flexible framework for Agent-Based Models (ABM), the 'epiworldR' package provides methods for prototyping disease outbreaks and transmission models using a 'C++' backend, making it very fast. It supports multiple epidemiological models, including the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS), Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR), and others, involving arbitrary mitigation policies and multiple-disease models. Users can specify infectiousness/susceptibility rates as a function of agents' features, providing great complexity for the model dynamics. Furthermore, 'epiworldR' is ideal for simulation studies featuring large populations.

## Statistical Alerts (time series)

We have supported an Operations system for processing time series for “aberrations” (aka, “alerts”, “potential outbreaks”) for 8+ years in VA BASIC.

This includes several classes of numerical methods, of which some are window-based, control chart-based or trained linear models.  A brief presentation on this is attached here.
